  Task 1: The Stairway (steps.c)
One Giant wants to climb the Magical Tower stairway. He knows he could step over each K-th stair. An Old Troll is asking the Giant how many stairs will he step in total if there are N stairs in the stairway. Write a program, that will help Giant answer the Old Troll.
The program accepts N and K as *command-line arguments* (not stdin) and returns the total number of stairs the Giant steps to stdout.

  Task 2: The Bridge (cables.c)
The Greedy King wants to collect tribute for each span of the Magical Bridge the merchants pass. He wants to install special wired sensors on each of the spans, with communication cables leading directly to the Treasury Department base station located at one bank of the river. He asked the Mighty Wizard to calculate the total length of the cables. But Mighty Wizard knows that there will be no enough cables in the whole Kingdom and it's better to use wireless solutions. Help him convince the Greedy King.
Write a program that will help the Mighty Wizard to calculate the total length of the cables required. A program accepts two *command-line arguments*, N - the total number of spans the Magical Bridge has, and the second argument D - the distance between the spans (all spans are distributed evenly and the distance from the bank of the river to the first span is also D), and returns the total length of the cables.
Note: keep in mind that the Greedy King is so greedy that he will not allow the Mighty Wizard to use the computational power of the governmental computer before making sure the Wizard's program uses heavily optimized mathematical formulas.
